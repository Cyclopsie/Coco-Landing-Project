            <h1>Welcome to Pineapple's Stardom</h1>
            <div class="bio">Pineapple is just like the fruit. Never know when she will be sour or sweet. Her eyes remind me of the color of a pineapple. She was born the year of a DOG...which makes sense. She prefers to be around dogs vs cats. Overall her minion of choice is Human #1 (the colored hair...weird lady) with backup Human #2 (the cringe funny kidnapping man)</div>
